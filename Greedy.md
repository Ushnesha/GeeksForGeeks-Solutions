### Gas Station <a name="gasStation"></a>
##### There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is A[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs B[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

        int tank = 0, idx = 0, tot = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++){
            int consume = A[i] - B[i];
            tank += consume;
            if(tank<0){
